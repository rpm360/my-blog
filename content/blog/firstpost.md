If you're reading this, welcome! I'm Rohit — an AI Systems Engineer currently building intelligent systems at [Rocket Mortgage](https://www.rocketmortgage.com/) in Atlanta.

I've spent the last 6+ years working at the intersection of software engineering and artificial intelligence, from building conversational AI bots at Kore.ai to architecting multi-agent systems that handle millions of requests in production.

## Why a blog?

I've learned so much from engineers who share their knowledge openly — blog posts that saved me hours of debugging, architecture write-ups that shaped how I think about systems, and tutorials that helped me pick up new tools. It's time I give back.

This blog is where I'll write about:

- **Building AI systems in production** — not just the theory, but the messy reality of deploying LLMs at scale
- **Multi-agent orchestration** — patterns, pitfalls, and what actually works when you need multiple AI agents to collaborate
- **Cloud engineering** — AWS, Kubernetes, and the infrastructure that makes AI systems reliable
- **Lessons from the field** — things I wish I knew earlier, debugging war stories, and career reflections

## What I won't do

I'm not going to write generic "What is AI?" explainers. There are plenty of those. Instead, I'll share the things I've learned by actually building and operating these systems — the decisions, trade-offs, and hard-won insights that come from production experience.

## Let's connect

If any of this resonates with you, I'd love to connect. Find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/rpm360) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/rohit-marathe-ucf), or just keep reading.

Let's build something cool. 🚀
