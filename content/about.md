# About Me

I'm **Rohit Marathe**, an AI Systems Engineer based in Atlanta, GA with 6+ years of experience building intelligent software systems.

Currently at **Rocket Mortgage**, I architect high-availability GenAI pipelines that handle millions of requests at 99.9% uptime. My day-to-day involves designing multi-agent orchestration frameworks, building self-healing incident resolution systems, and optimizing LLM infrastructure for production workloads.

- **Multi-Agent Systems** — Orchestrating specialized AI agents with AWS Bedrock for complex workflows like mortgage processing and property search
- **LLM Orchestration** — Building failover systems across Claude/GPT-4 with rate-limiting guardrails for peak concurrency
- **RAG & Knowledge Systems** — Developing retrieval-augmented generation pipelines with function calling and MCP servers
- **AI Observability** — Automated LLM-as-a-Judge pipelines using Langfuse and Dynatrace for continuous quality evaluation
